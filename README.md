Redux Saga based state machines.

**A work in progress**

## Publishing a new version

```
yarn run publish
```

This will ask for the new version number, update the `package.json` files, add a git tag, and push the changes to GitHub.

CircleCI will then pick up the tag, build the packages and publish them.
