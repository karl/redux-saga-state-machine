**A work in progress**

## Publishing a new version

- Update the version in each `package.json`. Ensure all the versions are the same.
- Push the updated code to GitHub.
- In GitHub create a new release (https://github.com/karl/redux-saga-state-machine/releases/new). Ensure the tag version is of the form `vX.X.X`.
- CircleCI will automatically pick up the tag and publish a new version of each package.
